#Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the
# total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

#The idea behind this approach is as follows: If the cumulative sum(represented by sum[i]sum[i] for sum up to i^{th}i th
#index) up to two indices is the same, the sum of the elements
# lying in between those indices is zero. Extending the same
# thought further, if the cumulative sum up to two indices, say
# ii and jj is at a difference of kk i.e. if sum[i] - sum[j] = ksum[i]âˆ’sum[j]=k,
# the sum of elements lying between indices ii and jj is kk.
