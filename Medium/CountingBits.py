# Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the
# range 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ num calculate the number of 1's in
# their binary representation and return them as an array.

# <<
# When shifting left, the most-significant bit is lost,
# and a 00 bit is inserted on the other end.
# A single left shift multiplies a binary number by 2:

# >>
#When shifting right with a logical right shift,
# the least-significant bit is lost and a 00 is inserted on the other end.
#For positive numbers, a single logical right shift divides a number by 2,
# throwing out any remainders.
