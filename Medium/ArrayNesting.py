# A zero-indexed array A of length N contains all integers from 0 to N-1. Find and return the longest length of
# set S, where S[i] = {A[i], A[A[i]], A[A[A[i]]], ... } subjected to the rule below.
#
# Suppose the first element in S starts with the selection of element A[i] of index = i, the next element in S
# should be A[A[i]], and then A[A[A[i]]]â€¦ By that analogy, we stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in S.
#
# The tricky part here is that the numbers always form a ring, and no matter which number of this
# ring you start with total count will always be same, so no need to step on it one more time......
