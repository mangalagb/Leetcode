# Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
#
# Follow up:
#
# Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways
# to solve this problem.
# Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

#This approach is based on the fact that when we rotate the array k times,
# k%nk elements from the back end of the array come to the front and the rest
# of the elements from the front shift backwards.

# In this approach, we firstly reverse all the elements of the array.
# Then, reversing the first k elements followed by reversing the rest n-knâˆ’k
# elements gives us the required result.
#
# Let n = 7 and k = 3
#
# Original List                   : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
# After reversing all numbers     : 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
# After reversing first k numbers : 5 6 7 4 3 2 1
# After revering last n-k numbers : 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 --> Result
